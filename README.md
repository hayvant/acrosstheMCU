# Movies meet Giphy

> Our group worked collaboratively to create a website that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project uses development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests. We have conceived and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitch:
> Welcome all movie buffs! Do you have a passionate interest in cinema and giphys? Youâ€™ve come to the right place! Search your favorite movies and our application database will obtain the movie information and generate a short looping- a giphy to match it!
> Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
> Process: The technologies that we used to create this website were HTML, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Javascript, and Jquery.
> How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
