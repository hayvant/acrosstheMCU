# Movies meet Giphy

> Our group worked collaboratively to create a website that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project uses development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests. We have conceived and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitch:

> Welcome all movie buffs! Do you have a passionate interest in cinema and giphys? Youâ€™ve come to the right place! Search your favorite movies and the application database will obtain the movie information and generate a short looping- a giphy, to match it! Our application accepts and responds to user input and also has a clean and polished interface with humor that will brighten your day! Enjoy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This website has met the following requirements:

* Usea CSS framework other thn Bootstrap.
* Deployed to GitHub pages. 
* Polished user interface.
* Allows user interaction.
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.`localStorage`.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
