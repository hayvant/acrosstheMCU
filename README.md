# Movies meet Giphy

> Our group worked collaboratively to create a website that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project uses development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests. We have conceived and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Pitch:
> A one minute description of your application.
> Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
> Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
